Interests

ðŸ‘€ I have a keen interest in Cloud Computing and Hybrid Networking. The ability to leverage the power of the cloud while maintaining a hybrid network infrastructure excites me. I enjoy working on projects that involve designing, implementing, and optimizing network solutions to ensure seamless integration between on-premises and cloud environments.
Current Learning Goals

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge and skills in the following areas:

    Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS is a leading cloud service provider, and I am learning how to use its various services effectively. This includes understanding core services like EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, and more.

    Red Hat Technologies: I am exploring Red Hat technologies, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat OpenShift, to gain expertise in managing and securing enterprise-level infrastructure.

    Kubernetes: As containerization and orchestration have become crucial in modern IT environments, I'm learning Kubernetes to efficiently manage and deploy containerized applications.

    Cisco: Cisco is a major player in the networking industry, and I'm dedicated to mastering Cisco's networking solutions. This involves learning about Cisco routers, switches, and other networking devices, as well as Cisco's certifications.

    VMware: Virtualization is a fundamental technology in modern data centers, and VMware is a leading provider of virtualization solutions. I'm delving into VMware's products like vSphere and vCenter to understand virtualization management and deployment.
